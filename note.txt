The Add-on requires a trusted SSL certificate in order to run on https://localhost
✔ How do you want to set up your SSL certificate › Automatically, set it up for me

Setting up self-signed SSL certificate ...
This is only a one time step and may require you to enter your system's password,
so that the SSL certificate can be added to your system's trusted certificate path.
[If this takes longer than expected, please break and retry]
[sudo] password for pc2:
rm: cannot remove '/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/devcert.crt': No such file or directory
rehash: warning: skipping ca-certificates.crt,it does not contain exactly one certificate or CRL


WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.


SSL setup complete!
You can find the SSL certificate in /home/pc2/.config/Adobe/CCWebAddOn/devcert/domains/localhost.

Success! Created my-addon at /home/pc2/Desktop/AdobeExpressHackathon/my-addon.
Inside this directory, you can run the following commands:

  npm run build
    Builds the Add-on.
  npm run start
    Starts the development server and hosts the Add-on.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd my-addon
  npm run build
  npm run start

So what will you create today?
